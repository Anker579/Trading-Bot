st.write("This very common algorithm works by calculating two simple moving averages for the data, right now the given two are a 50 and 100 data point moving average, then, if the former has moved above the latter it will return a buy signal, and vice versa for moving below.")
st.write("This means that this algorithm will only output a buy or sell signal, never a '0' or 'don't buy' signal, as such the model only makes a purchase each time the data pattern changes to a buy signal, not everytime there is a buy signal, to prevent over-buying. This does however mean it takes less advantage of large upswings in a pairs performance, but ofcourse means less risk.")

st.write("This algorithm instead only uses information about the last two candles (data point) to determine a buy, sell or nothing signal. It's method is best explained by an image showcasing the requirements for a buy or sell signal, shown below.")

st.write("This algorithm therefore often returns a 0 or 'no action' signal, which is helpful to not always have a return and look for a specific behaviour, however, the behaviour this algorithm looks for can as easily occur due to approximately random fluctuations in a pairs value and therefore can make poor trades")
